# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer data from a telecom company to understand **why customers leave (churn)** and identify the key services driving this behavior.  

The analysis combines **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** to reveal patterns in churn and provide insights for retention strategies.

## Dataset
- Source: Telecom customer dataset  
- Format: CSV  
- Key Features:
  - `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`, `InternetService`
  - `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`
  - `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies`
  - `Churn` (target variable: Yes/No)

---

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removed duplicates and missing values
   - Standardized categorical features
   - Ensured target balance for fair comparison

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Count plots comparing churn vs non-churn
   - Service-based churn analysis
   - Identified high-risk groups of customers

3. **Final Visualization**
   - A composite figure summarizing **service usage vs churn** (see below)

---

## Key Insights (Report Summary)
- **Phone Service:** Customers with phone service churned more than those without.  
- **Internet Service:**  
  - **Fiber optic** users show the **highest churn rates**, while DSL users are relatively stable.  
  - Customers without internet service have the lowest churn rate.  
- **Security & Support:**  
  - Customers **without online security, backup, or device protection** are more likely to churn.  
  - Lack of **tech support** is also strongly linked to churn.  
- **Streaming Services:** Surprisingly, churn is higher among customers who use streaming services (TV & movies), suggesting bundled entertainment does not prevent churn.
